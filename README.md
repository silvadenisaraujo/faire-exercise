# Faire Backend Exercise

Using the Faire API, you will write a program that accepts an API key as a single command line parameter, which should be sent with all requests in the X-FAIRE-ACCESS-TOKEN header, and does the following:

* Consumes all products for a given brand, recording the inventory levels for each product option
* Consumes all orders, accepting the order if there is inventory to fulfill the order and it is not already accepted, otherwise it marks the items that donâ€™t have enough inventory as backordered
* Update the inventory levels of product options as each order is moved to processing
* After all orders have been read, the program should print the following metrics, plus 2 of your choosing, and then exit - your creativity is welcome!
  - The best selling product option
  - The largest order by dollar amount
  - The state with the most orders

** This is a simple solution for the exercise as many assumptions had to be taken and also the time restrictions. **
